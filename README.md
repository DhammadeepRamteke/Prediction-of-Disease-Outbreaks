Prediction of Disease Outbreaks

The Prediction of Disease Outbreaks project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. It leverages AI to analyze health parameters and provide real-time risk assessments, aiding in early diagnosis and prevention. The project is developed using Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
